# 2.01 Activity 2

List at least three advantages of relational databases over data stored in for eg. excel sheets, google spreadsheets, and other files such as `.txt`, `.csv`, etc.

1. Computational power which improves speed 
2. Storage of multiple data types (image, video, other files)
3. Dedicated language to retrieve files => more flexible


**Hint**: For eg., different tools have been developed to work with relational databases to query data. You can also talk about ACID principles (_Google is your friend. :wink:_).
