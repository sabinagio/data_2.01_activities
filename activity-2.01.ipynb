    "#### Activity 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct some research on the differences between structured and unstructured data. You can use the following link for reference: [https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html). Feel free to use any other resource as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every student would explain one difference to the other students in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structured data has a pre-defined model whereas unstructured data doesn't\n",
    "- Structured data is easily searchable compared to unstructured data\n",
    "- Structured data is typically text data, whereas unstructured data usually includes images, text, etc.\n",
    "- Structured data can reside in warehouses & relational databases, whereas unstructured data resides in warehouses, non-relational databases, applications, and data lakes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity 2\n",
    "\n",
    "List at least three advantages of relational databases over data stored in for eg. excel sheets, google spreadsheets, and other files such as `.txt`, `.csv`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ability to handle larger data\n",
    "2. Storage of multiple data types (image, video, other files), although it wouldn't necessarily be used\n",
    "3. Relational databases have stricter rules for storing data than excel, .txt, .csv, leading to improved data integrity\n",
    "4. Improved data consistency - a value changed in a column will be reflected in all tables in a relational database => no duplicates & immediate updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: For eg., different tools have been developed to work with relational databases to query data. You can also talk about ACID principles (_Google is your friend. :wink:_).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Atomicity**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> All changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation. That is, all the changes are performed, or none of them are. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Consistency**   \n",
    "\n",
    "> Data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends.\n",
    "For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the consistency property ensures that the total value of funds in both the accounts is the same at the start and end of each transaction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Isolation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions. As a result, transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized.\n",
    "For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the isolation property ensures that another transaction sees the transferred funds in one account or the other, but not in both, nor in neither.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Durability**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> After a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist and are not undone, even in the event of a system failure. For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the durability property ensures that the changes made to each account will not be reversed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the bank database case study using `files_for_activities/case_study_bank.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brainstorm on some questions that could be answered through the information available in the database. You can check what kind of information can you extract from different tables provided in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of information that we can find:\n",
    "- Using the loan and district tables, we can find which districts use more loans and whether those are typically paid in full\n",
    "- Using the trans table, we can find the how many transactions occur daily and their average amount\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to `files_for_activities/mysql_dump.sql` database. Load it to Sequel Pro, and there you will find a `bank` database which we will use for the following exercise. This is the same database used for the class example. Keep using the `bank` database for iterations that are related to it (3 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `select` statement is used as a print command in SQL. Use the `select` statement to print \"Hello World\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT 'Hello World';`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the select statement to perform a simple mathematical calculation to add two numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT 1 + 2;`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use an appropriate `select` statement to retrieve a list of unique card types from the `bank` database. (**Hint**: You can use DISTINCT function here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT DISTINCT type FROM card;`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Get a list of all the district names in the bank database. Suggestion is to use the `files_for_activities/case_study_extended` here to work out which column is required here because we are looking for the names of places, not just the IDs. It would be great to see the results under the heading `district_name`. (**Hint**: Use an alias.). You should have 77 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT A2 AS district_name FROM district;`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bonus: Revise your query to also show the Region, and limit the results to just 30 rows. Sort the results alphabetically by district name A>Z before selecting the 30.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    A2 AS district_name,\n",
    "    A3 AS region\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    district\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "    district_name ASC\n",
    "LIMIT\n",
    "    30;"
